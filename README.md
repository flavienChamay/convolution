You have different transformations that you can use : "binarisation", "dilatation", "erosion", "etalement", "inversion", "median" and "moyen". Each file produced by the make command corresponds to a type of transformation.
If you want to do a dilatation type:
./erosion inputImage.pbm filter.mx outputImage.pbm

You have the desired images in the folder "imgOutputToCompare", you have the input images at "imgInput" and the images produced (the result of the program) at "imgResult". Each images in "imgIput" has its correspondent in the "imgResult" folder. After, you can check if the images in "imgResult" corresponds with the program "comparaison" (use -h more more infos).
